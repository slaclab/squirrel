Saving Snapshots
=================

Snapshots can be saved from any page by clicking on the "Save Snapshot" button
at the bottom of the control panel. The dialog asks for a title and optional
description; click "Save" or press ``Enter`` to accept, or click "Cancel" or press
``Esc`` to cancel.

After the dialog is accepted, the app will begin saving values for all PVs.
The app will be unresponsive while PVs are being saved, but it will open the new
snapshot once it's complete.
