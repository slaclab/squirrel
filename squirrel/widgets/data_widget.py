class DataWidget(QtWidgets.QWidget):
    """
    Base class for widgets that manipulate dataclasses.

    Defines the init args for all data widgets and handles synchronization
    of the ``QDataclassBridge`` instances. This is done so that only data
    widgets need to consider how to handle bridges and the page classes
    simply need to pass in data structures, rather than needing to keep track
    of how two widgets editing the same data structure must share the same
    bridge object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : any dataclass
        The dataclass that the widget needs to manipulate. Most widgets are
        expecting either specific dataclasses or dataclasses that have
        specific matching fields.
    kwargs : QWidget kwargs
        Passed directly to QWidget's __init__. Likely unused in most cases.
        Even parent is unlikely to see use because parent is set automatically
        when a widget is inserted into a layout.
